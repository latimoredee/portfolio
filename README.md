Call Center Performance Dashboard
Project Overview
 
This dashboard analyzes Call Center Agent Performance using mock call log data to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as call volume, average handling time (AHT), customer satisfaction score (CSAT), and resolution rate. The goal is to identify trends, performance gaps, and opportunities for coaching or process improvement.

Objectives
 
- Visualize call center performance at the agent and team level
- Track volume, efficiency, and quality metrics
- Enable stakeholders and supervisors to identify top and bottom performers
- Support data-driven decision-making for coaching, staffing, and training needs

Tools Used
 
- Microsoft Excel (initial data prep, pivot summaries)
- Power BI (dashboard development)
- Optional: SQL Server (for mock dataset generation)

KPIs Tracked
 
- Calls Handled (per agent and daily)
- Average Handling Time (AHT)
- First Call Resolution Rate (FCR)
- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score
- Repeat Call Rate
- Agent Coaching Status

Summary of Findings
 
- Agents with high call volume but low FCR were flagged for process coaching.
- AHT spikes on certain days aligned with longer issue types.
- CSAT scores dropped significantly on weekends; potential understaffing issue.
- Repeat call rate was highest among new agents with <30 days of experience.

Stakeholder Goals
 
- Improve FCR by 15% within the next quarter
- Reduce repeat calls by identifying knowledge gaps
- Align coaching sessions with performance data weekly
- Create an automated dashboard for ongoing tracking

Notes
 
- Data is fictional but modeled after realistic industry call center logs.
- Dashboard design prioritizes clarity, interaction, and insight.
- Future versions will integrate real-time data streaming and agent notes tracking.
